**flag2folder** is a Python-based console application designed to simplify file organization on your system. This tool allows users to automatically sort files into designated folders based on specific "flags" found in their filenames, making it particularly useful for managing large numbers of files in a structured and efficient manner.

## Key Features

- **Custom Flag/Folder Mapping**: Users can define unique flags and corresponding folder names. Files containing these flags in their names are automatically moved to the specified folders.
- **Directory Flexibility**: Set source and destination directories with ease. The tool defaults to the current directory but allows for quick changes as needed.
- **Interactive Console Interface**: Straightforward and user-friendly, the console interface guides users through setting flags, adding/removing folder pairs, and executing the sorting process.
- **Preview & Confirmation**: Before executing, the tool provides a preview of the expected file organization, requiring user confirmation to proceed. This ensures accuracy and user control.
